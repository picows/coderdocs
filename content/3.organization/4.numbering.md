Title: Numbering
---

The section and subsection numbers are shown preceeding the titles in the sidebar menu.

### The template numbers the sub/sections in aphabetical order of the file/folder names

For example, the following **folder/file.md - Title** in a *~/content* directory ...

<pre>
- apples/index.md - Fruit	
  - big.md - New York
  - green.md - Tangy
  - red.md - Delicous
  - yellow.md  - Unusual
- bats/index.md - Sport
  - actual.md - Vampire
  - baseball.md - Stadium
  - cricket.md - West Indies
- cats/index.md - Animals
  - cool.md - Pictures
  - house.md - Garfield
  - wild.md - Thunder
</pre>

Would produce the menu numbering:

<pre>
- 1 - Fruit	
  - 1.1 - New York
  - 1.2 - Tangy
  - 1.3 - Delicous
  - 1.4 - Unusual
- 2 - Sport
  - 2.1 - Vampire
  - 2.2 - Stadium
  - 2.3 - West Indies
- 3 - Animals
  - 3.1 - Pictures
  - 3.2 - Garfield
  - 3.3 - Thunder
</pre>

**Note** that even though "**A**nimals" comes before "**F**ruit" alphabetically its section ("3 - Animals") is still below "1 - **F**ruit". That's because its *folder*, "**c**ats", comes after "**a**pples".

Similarly, "1.1 **N**ew York" comes before "1.3 - **D**elicous" because the file name "**b**ig.md" comes before "**r**ed.md" alphabetically.

### Reorder the menu by changing the folder and file names

For example:

- To make "Thunder" appear first under section "3 - Animals" rename the "**w**ild.md" file so it is alphabetically before the "**c**ool.md" file.
- Can be done by renaming "**w**ild.md" to "**a**wild.md".

Now the file structure will look like

<pre>
- apples/index.md - Fruit	
  - big.md - New York
  - green.md - Tangy
  - red.md - Delicous
  - yellow.md  - Unusual
- bats/index.md - Sport
  - actual.md - Vampire
  - baseball.md - Stadium
  - cricket.md - West Indies
- cats/index.md - Animals
  - <b>awild.md - Thunder</b>
  - <b>cool.md - Pictures</b>
  - house.md - Garfield
</pre>

Thus the new menu will look like

<pre>
- 1 - Fruit	
  - 1.1 - New York
  - 1.2 - Tangy
  - 1.3 - Delicous
  - 1.4 - Unusual
- 2 - Sport
  - 2.1 - Vampire
  - 2.2 - Stadium
  - 2.3 - West Indies
- 3 - Animals
  - <b>3.1 - Thunder</b>
  - <b>3.2 - Pictures</b>
  - 3.3 - Garfield
</pre>

### A file name prefix helps

The sample content prefixes folder and file names with numbers. Doing that for the example above would give a directory structure:

<pre>
- 1.about/index.md - Fruit	
  - 1.big.md - New York
  - 2.green.md - Tangy
  - 3.red.md - Delicous
  - 4.yellow.md  - Unusual
- 2.bats/index.md - Sport
  - 1.actual.md - Vampire
  - 2.baseball.md - Stadium
  - 3.cricket.md - West Indies
- 3.cats/index.md - Animals
  - 1.cool.md - Pictures
  - 2.house.md - Garfield
  - 3.wild.md - Thunder
</pre>

Now files can be ordered by changing the prefix numbers, yet keeping file names readable. For example, "Thunder" can be placed first in section 3 by renaming "3.wild.md" to "0.wild.md".

Prefix numbers also make it easier to to insert files. For example, one way to insert "Batman" in between "Vampire" and "Stadium" in section 2 is:

1. Rename  "**1.**actual.md" to "**1.0.**actual.md"
2. Create the file "**1.1.**knight.md" with the title "Batman"

Now the directory structure will look like.

<pre>
- 1.about/index.md - Fruit	
  - 1.big.md - New York
  - 2.green.md - Tangy
  - 3.red.md - Delicous
  - 4.yellow.md  - Unusual
- 2.bats/index.md - Sport
  - <b>1.0.actual.md - Vampire</b>
  - <b>1.1.knight.md - Batman</b>
  - 2.baseball.md - Stadium
  - 3.cricket.md - West Indies
- 3.cats/index.md - Animals
  - 1.cool.md - Pictures
  - 2.house.md - Garfield
  - 3.wild.md - Thunder
</pre>

Using *two* numbers in the prefix would be easier. If the structure was:

<pre>
- 20.bats/index.md - Sport
  - 10.actual.md - Vampire
  - 20.baseball.md - Stadium
  - 30.cricket.md - West Indies
</pre>

It was only necessary to create the file "**15.**knight.md" to get

<pre>
- 2.bats/index.md - Sport
  - <b>10.actual.md - Vampire</b>
  - <b>15.knight.md - Batman</b>
  - 20.baseball.md - Stadium
  - 30.cricket.md - West Indies
</pre>

Dates as a prefix can also work e.g. 20220901.coderdocs.md. Any kind of convention will help. They are quite common. 

It is possible to automate the re/generation of prefix numbers to keep the directory structure tidy.
