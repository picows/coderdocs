Title: Overview

Each folder in **~/content** is a section of the documentation.

- The *title, description and icon* is edited in the **index.md** file in that folder.
- The sections are numbered according to the alphabetical order of the folder names.

Each file (other than **index.md**) in any folder corresponds to a subsection.

- The title and content of the subsection is edited in that file.
- The subsections are numbered according to the alphabetical order of the file names.

**NOTE:** The numbering **does not** take into account the actual names of the folders and files only their aphabetical ordering.

Basically, the sections are numbered according to their order in a desktop file explorer.

Reorder sections and subsections by changing folder/file names.

Using a *file/folder prefix* helps.

- It keeps the file/folder names readable.
- It is easier to insert a section/subsection without renaming existing items.

Please see the examples that follow.
