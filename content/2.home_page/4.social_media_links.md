The social media icons are displayed in the header and footer of all pages.

Each has a title, url and icon. You can add or remove from the list as you see fit.

The icons are Font Awesome Free 5.15.3 **Brands** style. To choose an icon:

1. Search for it on [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com "Font Awesome website"). Ensure:
   - The version is correct (or as close as possible)
   - Results are filtered for "Free" and "Brands"
3. Copy the icon name from there.
