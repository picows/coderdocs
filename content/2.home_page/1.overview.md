Title: Overview

Aside from the section summaries, information for the home page can be edited in two files.

1. **~/content/_meta.md**  
	a. Favicon  
	b. Logo  
	c. Social Media Links

2. **~/content/index.md**  
	a. Page Title and Subtitle  
	b. Call to Action information.

**The use of these files is covered below.**

Each section is contained in a **~/content/[section_name]** folder. The section summaries come from **~/content/[section_name]/index.md** in these folders.

### Formatting

The *attributes* of each page is stored in the YAML header of the documents.

The format is simple. Essentially: the name of the attribute, followed a colon (":"), single **space** *then* the value of the attribute. For example:

> \-\-\-  
> Favicon: favicon.ico  
> Logo: coderdocs-logo.svg  
> \-\-\-

**Precision** is needed here:

1. Attribute names are **case sensitive**.
2. **Be careful with the spacing** to ensure the file is parsed peoperly i.e. webpage displays properly.

This sample documentation provides examples of all the files needed. For more information on content formatting see the [Pico Documentation](https://picocms.org/docs/#text-file-markup "Text File Markup").

### Files

**All files** referenced in the attributes *must* be placed in the **~/assets** folder.

So in the example above we have:

	Logo: coderdocs-logo.svg

This means the logo's location is **~/assets/coderdocs-logo.svg**
