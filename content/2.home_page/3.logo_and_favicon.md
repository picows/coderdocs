Title: Logo and Favicon
---

The Logo and Favicon are in the **~/content/_meta.md** header

### Images

> Favicon: favicon.ico  
> Logo: coderdocs-logo.svg  

To change the logo and favicon:

1. Place these images in the **~/assets** folder.
2. Replace the file names in **~/content/_meta.md**

So in the example above we have:

> Favicon: favicon.ico 

This means the favicon's location is **~/assets/favicon.ico**

The current logo is *40px x 40px*.

### Text

The logo has a text portion consisting of some bold text followed by normal.

> **Coder**Docs

Both parts can be edited in the **~/content/_meta.md** header.

> LogoText_Bold: Coder  
> LogoText_Normal: Docs

Omit one or both.
