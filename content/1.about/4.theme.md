Title: Theme
---

The theme is the contents of **~/themes/coderdocs** folder.

Use it on another Pico installation by:

1. Copying **~/themes/coderdocs** to **thewebsite.com/themes/coderdocs**
2. Setting **theme: coderdocs** in **thewebsite.com/config/config.yml**

For simplicity: the plugin, theme and documentation (acting as sample content) is already installed on this Pico instance.
